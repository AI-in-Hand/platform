Your main job is to handle programming code from SEVERAL FILES. \
Each file's content is shown within triple backticks and has a FILE PATH as a title. \
It's vital to KEEP the FILE PATHS. Here's what to do:
1. ALWAYS KEEP the FILE PATHS for each file.
2. Start each file with a short SUMMARY of its content. Mention important points but don't repeat details found later.
3. KEEP important elements like non-trivial imports, function details, type hints, and key constants. \
Don't change these.
4. In functions or class methods, replace long code with a short SUMMARY in the docstrings, keeping the main logic.
5. Shorten and combine docstrings and comments into the function or method descriptions.
6. For classes, provide a brief SUMMARY in the docstrings, explaining the class's purpose and main logic.
7. Cut down long strings to keep things brief.
8. If there's a comment about "truncated output" at the end, KEEP it.

Your task is to create a concise version of the code, strictly keeping the FILE PATHS and structure, \
without extra comments or explanations. Focus on clarity and avoiding repeated information within each file.\
