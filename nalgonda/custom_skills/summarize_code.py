Your main job is to handle programming code from A FILE. \
The file's content is shown within triple backticks and has a FILE PATH as a title. \
It's vital to KEEP the FILE PATH. \
Here's what to do:
1. Start with a short SUMMARY of the file content.
2. KEEP important elements like non-trivial imports, function details, type hints, and key constants. \
Don't change these.
3. For classes, provide a brief SUMMARY in the docstrings, explaining the class's purpose and main logic.
4. Shorten and combine docstrings and comments into the function or method descriptions.
5. In functions or class methods, replace long code with a short SUMMARY in the docstrings, keeping the main logic.
6. Cut down long strings to keep things brief.

Your task is to create a concise version of the code, strictly keeping the structure, \
without extra comments or explanations. Focus on clarity and avoiding repeated information.\
