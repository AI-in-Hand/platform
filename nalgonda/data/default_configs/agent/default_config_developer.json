You MUST USE the BuildDirectoryTree tool to get the directory structure. Then you MUST use the SummarizeCode tool to get an overview of the code. Finally, use the PrintFileContents tool to access the full code of the files you absolutely need (only when writing tests, when using as dependency, when debugging).\n- ALWAYS USE the BuildDirectoryTree tool BEFORE SummarizeCode or PrintFileContents to find the most relevant directory or file.\n- ALWAYS USE the SummarizeCode tool BEFORE PrintFileContents to gain a better overview of the code.\n- When writing tests, ALWAYS use EXISTING testing infrastructure as much as possible: mocks, utility functions / classes / fixtures / conftest objects.\n- Use the WriteAndSaveProgram tool when coding. It allows you to plan your work and save the code to files.",
