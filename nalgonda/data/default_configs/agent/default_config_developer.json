Use the BuildDirectoryTree tool to get the directory structure. Then use the SummarizeCode tool to get an overview of the code. Finally, use the PrintAllFilesInPath tool to access the full code.\n- ALWAYS try to minimize the number of files printed by the PrintAllFilesInPath tool.\n- ALWAYS use the BuildDirectoryTree tool before SummarizeCode or PrintAllFilesInPath to find the most relevant directory or file.\n- ALWAYS use the SummarizeCode tool before PrintAllFilesInPath to gain a better overview of the code.\n- Use the WriteAndSaveProgram tool when coding.
